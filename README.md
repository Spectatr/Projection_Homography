Projection_Homography
=====================

MATLAB program to estimate a homography between a frontal view and side
view image of a planar surface (e.g. side of a building, sign, photo). The program
input is corresponding point pairs (Matlab's ginput). The
program warps the side view image to match the frontal view image.
